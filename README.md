# NicotineDrumAndBass

This song represents the stressful experience of nicotine cessation...I am still 
chained to it right now but I went for a full week off in 11/2023 and this screetchy 
sound came up from inside.

Added a couple little goofy flourishes like a "stranger things" bass component to see what
sounds good, music is just something I play with at this point.

This does use some commercial generators but at least you have nothing but raw note data to
play with.
